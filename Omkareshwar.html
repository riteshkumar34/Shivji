    <section id="historical-info">
        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <P><b>The Jyotirlinga of Omkareshwar is located in Madhya 
            Pradesh along the banks of the Narmada River. The 
            eminent ‘Shikhara of Omkareshwar’ stands tall and proud 
            in the sky as if overlooking the entire earth. The temple is 
            mentioned in sacred Hindu texts like the Vedas and 
            Puranas. The island of Omkareshwar has a total of 6 
            pilgrimages and 33 deities making it a must-visit place for 
            spiritual seekers.
            A symbolic manifestation of “Om” formed by the curves of 
            Narmada makes the sacred site even more ethereal. 
            Omkareshwar is an epitome of the years-old Hindu 
            traditions and timeless religious influence of Shiva on his 
            devotees. This temple is the only place where Lord Shiva 
            appeared in an Omkara Swaroopa.
            The religious importance of Omkareshwar finds mention 
            in the Skanda Purana, the Shiv Purana, and the Vayu 
            Purana. It is believed that whoever worships Omkareshwar 
            with an unshakeable faith in Mahadev will attain respite 
            from all the evils present on earth</b></P>

   <header><strong>THE BIRTH OF TEMPLE</strong></header> 
 <em> There are several stories associated with Omkareshwar, as 
    mentioned in ancient Hindu texts. According to one, once 
    Narad Muni (a traveling Vedic sage) visited the Vindhya 
    Mountains and got enraged because there was no home 
    for Lord Shiva in the region. So, the God of Vindhya 
    Mountain started Tapasya (non-indulgence) to repent for 
    this mistake.
    He meditated on Lord Shiva in the form of the earthly lord. 
    His faith and patience impressed Mahadev (Lord Shiva) 
    who told the mountain god that he would reside on the 
    island as Pranava Linga. And it would be divided into two 
    parts- Mamleswar and Omkareswar. While Mamleswar 
    was an earthly linga, Omkareswas was a Jyoti Linga 
    (column of light). Since then, the place was named as 
    Omkareswar, and a temple was built to worship the 
    Jyotirlingam.
    Another story goes that King Mandhata of the Ishvaaku 
    dynasty (the one to which Lord Rama belonged) did 
    extreme penance here. Impressed by his faith, Shiva 
    blessed the king and appeared in this place in the form of 
    a Jyotirlinga, referred to as Omkawareswar.</em>
