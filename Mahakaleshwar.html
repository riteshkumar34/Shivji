        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <P><b>To understand the significance of the Mahakaleshwar Temple, one
            must journey back in time to explore the rich history of Ujjain
            Mahakal. The Mahakaleshwar Temple Ujjain history is intertwined
            with the vibrant tapestry of Ujjain, one of the seven sacred cities in
            Hinduism.
            The origins of this magnificent temple can be traced back to ancient
            times, making it one of the oldest shrines in India. Legends suggest
            that Lord Shiva himself chose to reside in the form of the
            “Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga” (lingam of light) at Ujjain to bless
            his devotees. The lingam is known as “Swayambhu,” which means
            self-manifested, underscoring its divine nature.</b></P>

   <header><strong>MYTHOLOGICAL BELIEFS</strong></header> 
 <em> The Mahakaleshwar Temple Ujjain is steeped in mythological tales
    that add to its allure. One such legend is associated with the demon
    king, Ravana. It is said that Ravana, an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva,
    attempted to carry the sacred lingam to Lanka. In the process, Lord
    Shiva crushed the lingam to thwart his efforts, leaving behind the
    fragments. These fragments are believed to have become the
    “Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga” and are enshrined in the temple.
    Another mythology tells the story of a farmer named Shrikhar, who
    inadvertently worshipped Lord Shiva in the form of a lingam while
    offering water to a cow. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva
    appeared before him and granted him a boon. Shrikhar requested that
    the lord reside in the form of the Jyotirlinga at Ujjain, blessing the city
    and its people with his divine presence.</em>
